# Keg Cop R

## Objective
Keg Cop R aims to be the successor of [KegCop](http://ipatch.github.io/KegCop/).  The code base is written primarily in JavaScript in hopes to encourage more developers to join the project, and to be able to deploy an app to both Android and iOS.  In this version, (Keg Cop R) the planned hardware is a Raspberry Pi with just a flow meter.  And the main objective of the software is track how much beer is left in a keg.

## History
The KegCop project started around July of 2012 before there were such libraries / frameworks that could deploy a code base to both Android and iOS.  The goal of the original KegCop software was to create and manage user accounts for a kegerator.  The hardware used to make a successful build included a Bluno, kegboard shield, kegboard coaster, solenoid cut off valve, and a flow meter.

## How it will work.
This app aims to be the frontend / interface to a kegerator that is running the appropriate software on a Raspberry Pi with a flow meter attached to it.  With each pour the Pi will track the amount of beer poured, and present the patrons of the kegerator with how much beer is left in the kegerator.

## Build
As of April 15th 2017, this project is a just a skeleton React Native project.
